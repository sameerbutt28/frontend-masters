// Great to hear that the code is working fine now! Let's highlight the key issues that were fixed and explain the changes:

// 1. **Correct  Usage of `queryKey` in `fetchPet`**: 
//    - **Original Issue**: The initial `Details` component didn't account for the structure expected by your `fetchPet` function. `fetchPet` was designed to receive an object with a `queryKey`, which is an array. The pet's `id` is the second element of this array (`queryKey[1]`).
//    - **Fix Applied**: The `useQuery` hook in the `Details` component was updated to correctly pass the `id` as part of the query key. This aligns with how `fetchPet` is designed to extract the `id` for the API request.

// 2. **Handling the Returned Data Structure**:
//    - **Original Issue**: There was an assumption about the structure of the data returned from `fetchPet`. The initial code was trying to access `results.data.pet[0]`, which might not align with the actual data structure returned by your API.
//    - **Fix Applied**: The code was revised to access `data.pets[0]`. This change was based on a common response format for APIs, where a list of items is returned under a pluralized key (in this case, `pets`). However, it's crucial that this aligns with the actual data structure returned by your API. If your API returns data in a different format, this part of the code should be adjusted accordingly.

// 3. **Error Handling and Loading State**:
//    - **Original Issue**: While not incorrect, the initial code could have been more robust in handling different states like loading, error, and no data scenarios.
//    - **Fix Applied**: Enhanced error handling was added to display an error message if there's an issue fetching data. Similarly, checks were added to handle scenarios where no data is available or the data format does not match the expected structure.

// By addressing these key areas, the `Details` component was aligned more closely with the expected behavior of the `fetchPet` function and the potential structure of the API response. This ensured that the component could correctly fetch and display the pet details. Remember, the exact data access patterns and error handling strategies may vary depending on the specific requirements and API response structures in different applications.
